---

## Install Required Packages

Install the following packages:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu php php-sqlite composer npm nodejs unzip
```
## Enable SQLite in your PHP Config File
1. Open your PHP config file with:  
    - `sudo nano /etc/php/php.ini`
2. Press `ctrl + w` and search for:  
    - `pdo_sqlite`
    -  `sqlite3`
3. Uncomment both lines by removing the `;`:  
    - `extension=pdo_sqlite`  
    - `extension=sqlite3`
4. Save and exit:
    - `ctrl + o` then `Enter` to save
    - `ctrl + x` to exit
## Create a Project with Composer
1. make/cd into the directory you would like the project to be generated e.g.:
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/Code  
    cd ~/Code
    ```  
2. Create the project with composer:  
    ```bash
    composer create-project laravel/laravel laravelapp
    ```
## Configure SQLite Database
1. Open your project in VSCode and ensure your `database.sqlite` file was auto generated at:  
    - `database/database.sqlite`
      
    *If not there, create with:*
    ```bash
    touch database/database.sqlite
    ```
2. open your `.env` file located at the root of your project and update the database settings:
     ```
     DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
     DB_DATABASE=./database/database.sqlite
     ```
3. Run migrations:
     `php artisan migrate`
## Start the App
1. Serve the project with:  
     `php artisan serve`
   
      By default, this will run the at:
   
     ```bash
     http://127.0.0.1:8000
     ```
## Install Laravel Breeze
1. Add `laravel/breeze` to your `composer.json`'s `require-dev` section:
     ```bash
     composer require laravel/breeze --dev
     ```
2. Install Laravel Breeze into your project:
    ```bash
    php artisan breeze:install
    ```
3. You will be prompted with the following options:
     ```
   ┌ Which Breeze stack would you like to install? ──────────────┐
   │ › ○ Blade with Alpine                                       │
   │   ● Livewire (Volt Class API) with Alpine                   │
   │   ○ Livewire (Volt Functional API) with Alpine              │
   │   ○ React with Inertia                                      │
   │   ○ Vue with Inertia                                        │
   │   ○ API only                                                │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     ```
   We will choose the second option.
   
4. Select if you would like dark mode support:
     ```
     ┌ Would you like dark mode support? ──────────────────────────┐
     │ ● Yes / ○ No                                                │
     └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     ```
     
5. Select your testing framework:
     ```
     ┌ Which testing framework do you prefer? ─────────────────────┐
     │ › ● Pest                                                    │
     │   ○ PHPUnit                                                 │
     └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     ```
     We will use Pest
   
6. Run `npm install` to install the new packages `Laravel Breeze` added to your `package.json` file:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
7. Run `php artisan migrate` to ensure the new tables generated by Breeze are migrated to your database:
     ```bash
     php artisan migrate
     ```
## *Optional* Seed Test User
If desired, you can generate a quick test user to login with:  
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```
the default credentials are:  
```
Email: test@example.com  
Password: password
```
## Run both the front and backend
1. Open up a terminal and input the following to run the backend:
     ```bash
     php artisan serve
     ```
2. Open up a second terminal and build the front end:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
     *Note:* we use `npm run dev` for hot reloading during development. However, if you want a static build then `npm run build` works just as well.
## Done
Visit the provided URL given in your `PHP` terminal after you ran `php artisan serve`:  
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
